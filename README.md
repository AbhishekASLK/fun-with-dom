```There are 20 DOM projects. These includes Query Selector, innerHTML, innerText, style, fontSize, backgroundColor, remove, value, submit(), appendChild, createElement and many more...```

I learned too much of things by solving these projets on DOM. So these are huge for my learning and I hope you too can gain from these projects as I did. They cover basic concepts about DOM. I have used this for my JavaScript learning. 

Also, I believe you would find it helpful if you get these projects also and try to solve them yourself as it is a good practice to improve your skills with coding and increase your knowledge about DOM.
